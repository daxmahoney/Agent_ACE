### Problem Statement -- The ACE score is a tally of different types of abuse, neglect, and other hallmarks of a rough childhood. According to the Adverse Childhood Experiences study, the more adverse experiences in your youth the greater the risk for later health problems.
### Why agents? -- Agents can retrieve and summarize on going research related to this issue. 

### What you created -- I created an Agent that will retrieve the latest research and summarize the output for consumption. This will allow researchers to more quickly keep up to date with new findings.

### The Build -- I used the Agent ADK to retrieve and summarize information related to Adverse Childhood Experiences. 

### If I had more time, this is what I'd do -- I would compare new research to existing research and see if there are changes. I would look at the various questionnaires that are being used by various entities (like state health departments) and compare them.
